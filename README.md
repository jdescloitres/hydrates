The purpose of this program is to have a graphical user interface to determine the composition, the equilibrium pressure and the structure of hydrates.

The file interface.py corresponds to the generic interface, the hydrate_algorithm_no_interface.py file corresponds to the calculations used in determining the final data. 
The file hydrate_algorithm_with_interface.py is the main file in this program. It uses the methods from hydrate_algorithm_no_interface.py to show the calculated data in the interface from interface.py.
This is how the program works.
